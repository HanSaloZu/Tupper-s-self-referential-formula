# Tupper-s-self-referential-formula-in-Python

This is a Python implementation of the Tupper's self-referential formula that can produce 17x106 pixel bitmaps.

Clone this repository and run the main.py file to see the result (Tupper's formula itself). The k.txt file already contains the required value.

You can configure the application by editing the config.py file. By changing `SCREEN_HEIGHT` and `SCREEN_WIDTH` you can resize the application window. `SCREEN_TITLE` is the title of the application window. By changing `PIXEL_SIZE` you can scale the image that will be drawn.

To draw your own image, you need to put the image k constant in the k.txt file and run the main.py file.
